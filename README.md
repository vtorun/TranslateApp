# TranslateApp
In this project, I developed an interface that enables users to translate between different languages. I utilized the capabilities of Redux Toolkit for state management and Redux Thunk to handle asynchronous actions effectively.

# Technologies Used

- **React**: Core framework of the project
- **@reduxjs/toolkit**: State management
- **react-redux**: Redux integration
- **axios**: For API requests
- **react-select**: User-friendly dropdown for language selection
- **tailwindcss**: Fast and flexible CSS styling
